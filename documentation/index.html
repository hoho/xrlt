<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
<p>Before we begin, let's talk buzzwords. I hope reader is familiar with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O">Asynchronous I/O</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>. Guess, familiarity
with these, guarantees familiarity with all the rest terms that would be
used.</p>

<h3 id="frontends">About Frontends and XRLT</h3>
<p>Frontend is a thing takes data from backend and transforms it to view.
Frontend is also a thing takes user's input and transmits it to backend.
For our purposes, backend is just some black box, that gives and takes
data.</p>

<p>XRLT is for creating frontends. It is a server-side scripting language.
Something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>, but almost
completely different.</p>

<p>The main difference is that XRLT is not a general-purpose language. You can
run spaceships with things like PHP, but that leads to a countless number of
ways to do the same. XRLT has a very limited set of instructions. It aims to
standardize and simplify common frontend development scenarios.</p>
